# Features

*Survey Assure is built around core functions that support the hashing, import and visualization of data that can be guaranteed on chain from live connections and archived sources.*

## Feature Highlights

**Data Connection**

Ability to connect to a survey data source through a plug-in tailored for that platform

**Normalization**

Ability to intake and format data for visualization, without manipulating the data

**Visualization**

Ability to visualize the incoming data in multiple formats, like charts and composites.


**Calculation**

Ability to apply formulas to data, to represent score metrics and high level results for topics.


**Immutability**

Ability to record all data on Blockchain, and guarantee it was free from tampering and manipulation


**Auditable**

Ability for each data set, chart and response to be audited to prove its validity.

**Localization**

The platform automatically imports any language data from your data sources, but you can also translate the rest of the software that isn't covered by those. To do that, you simply create a language file and upload it to the `frontend/src/localize/COUNTRY_CODE.js` folder. Use the `en.js` as a starting point and translate each "language key" accordingly. You can look at the sample Polish language file as a guide (`frontend/src/localize/pl.js`). By example, if you were translating to Spanish you would make a copy of `en.js`, rename it to `es.js`, and update the language code keys accordingly.

# Survey Assure API

The Survey Assure API was developed using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Koa](https://github.com/koajs/koa#readme). It relies on a [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.

## Documentation

Comprehensive Survey Assure Documentation can be found [here](https://newamericafoundation.github.io/digi_survey_assure). With regards to the API, we recommend reading over the "Installation, "Best Practices", and "Contributing" sections. These include information on rate limiting, benchmarks, best practices for scalability, and more.
